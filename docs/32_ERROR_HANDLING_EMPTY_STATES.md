# Error Handling and Empty States

## Purpose

Define predictable app behavior when data is missing, loading, invalid, or failed.

## Required States for Every Major Screen

- Loading
- Empty
- Error
- Permission denied
- Success
- Partial data

## Student-Friendly Error Rules

For students, especially younger students:

- Avoid scary language.
- Use simple instructions.
- Offer a safe next action.

Example:

```txt
We could not load this lesson. Try again or go back to your dashboard.
```

## Parent/Teacher Error Rules

Be more specific but still clear:

- What failed
- Whether data was saved
- What to try next

## Common Empty States

- No lessons assigned
- No reviews due
- No quiz attempts yet
- No linked students
- No completed lessons
- No weak skills detected

## Implementation Notes for Codex

- Create reusable EmptyState and ErrorState components.
- Do not leave blank screens.
- Do not expose stack traces to users.

## Definition of Done

This document is usable when:

- The purpose is clear.
- MVP requirements are separated from later-phase requirements.
- Required screens, data, permissions, and edge cases are identified.
- Codex can implement from it without inventing product rules.
- Safety, accessibility, and learning-pillar impacts are considered.

# V2 Implementation Expansion

## Document Status

- **Version:** 2.0
- **Readiness Target:** Codex-ready implementation guidance
- **Primary Dependency:** AGENTS.md, Product Bible, Core Pillars, MVP Scope
- **Core Learning Loop:** Teach → Break Down → Think → Discuss → Interpret → Prove → Practice → Retrieve → Space → Reflect → Adapt → Apply

## V2 Improvements Added

- Adds MVP versus later-phase boundary.
- Adds user-role implications.
- Adds data dependencies.
- Adds accessibility and safety checks.
- Adds empty/error state expectations.
- Adds acceptance criteria Codex can execute against.

## What This Document Must Lock

- Must align with the saved product loop and core pillars.
- Must not introduce features that bypass child safety or role permissions.
- Must support Grade 3/6/9 MVP before expansion.

## Implementation Requirements

- State screens/components needed.
- List data required and source of truth.
- Define permissions and user states.
- Add validation and QA criteria.
- Define empty states for no lessons, no reviews, no progress, no linked students, no class data, and failed content load.

## Data, Permission, and UX Considerations

| Concern | Required Treatment |
|---|---|
| Student data | Collect only what the feature needs; avoid sensitive logs. |
| Role access | Student, parent, teacher, and admin access must be explicit. |
| Accessibility | Use semantic UI, visible focus states, readable language, and non-color-only signals. |
| Empty states | Define what users see when no lessons, reviews, progress, or linked users exist. |
| Error states | Explain what failed and give a safe next action; never expose private internals. |
| Analytics | Track learning events by IDs/tags, not unnecessary personal text. |

## Codex Implementation Instructions

- Use this document before implementing related feature code.
- Create typed models/components based on the requirements.
- Add TODOs for later-phase items rather than mixing them into MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Codex can implement from the document without inventing missing product rules.
- MVP requirements are separated from later-phase expansion.
- User roles, data needs, permissions, empty states, errors, and accessibility are considered.
- The document connects back to the core learning loop and locked pillars.
- A reviewer can tell whether a feature is done, incomplete, or out of scope.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] The document separates MVP from later-phase work.
