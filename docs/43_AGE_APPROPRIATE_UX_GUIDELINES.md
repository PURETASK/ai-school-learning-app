# Age-Appropriate UX Guidelines

## Purpose

Define UX expectations by student developmental band.

## Foundation Academy K–5

- One major action per screen.
- Strong icons and visuals.
- Audio/read-aloud support later.
- Immediate feedback.
- Short lesson chunks.
- Parent support visible.

## Bridge Academy 6–8

- More choice and autonomy.
- Quest paths.
- Skill trees.
- Short written explanations.
- Study planner.
- Safe academic discussion prompts.

## Scholar Academy 9–12

- Course view.
- Assignments and deadlines later.
- Portfolio and rubric support.
- Research, essays, labs.
- Career/college readiness.

## Interaction Complexity

| Band | Navigation Depth | Lesson Length | Reading Density |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| K–2 | Very low | 5–10 min | Very low |
| 3–5 | Low | 10–20 min | Low/moderate |
| 6–8 | Moderate | 15–30 min | Moderate |
| 9–12 | Higher | 20–45 min | Higher |

## Implementation Notes

- Academy theme should affect layout density.
- Do not reuse high-school dashboard layout for elementary students.

## Definition of Done

This document is usable when:

- The purpose is clear.
- MVP requirements are separated from later-phase requirements.
- Required screens, data, permissions, and edge cases are identified.
- Codex can implement from it without inventing product rules.
- Safety, accessibility, and learning-pillar impacts are considered.

# V2 Implementation Expansion

## Document Status

- **Version:** 2.0
- **Readiness Target:** Codex-ready implementation guidance
- **Primary Dependency:** AGENTS.md, Product Bible, Core Pillars, MVP Scope
- **Core Learning Loop:** Teach → Break Down → Think → Discuss → Interpret → Prove → Practice → Retrieve → Space → Reflect → Adapt → Apply

## V2 Improvements Added

- Adds MVP versus later-phase boundary.
- Adds user-role implications.
- Adds data dependencies.
- Adds accessibility and safety checks.
- Adds empty/error state expectations.
- Adds acceptance criteria Codex can execute against.

## What This Document Must Lock

- Must align with the saved product loop and core pillars.
- Must not introduce features that bypass child safety or role permissions.
- Must support Grade 3/6/9 MVP before expansion.

## Implementation Requirements

- State screens/components needed.
- List data required and source of truth.
- Define permissions and user states.
- Add validation and QA criteria.
- Define UX differences for K–2, 3–5, 6–8, 9–12.

## Data, Permission, and UX Considerations

| Concern | Required Treatment |
|---|---|
| Student data | Collect only what the feature needs; avoid sensitive logs. |
| Role access | Student, parent, teacher, and admin access must be explicit. |
| Accessibility | Use semantic UI, visible focus states, readable language, and non-color-only signals. |
| Empty states | Define what users see when no lessons, reviews, progress, or linked users exist. |
| Error states | Explain what failed and give a safe next action; never expose private internals. |
| Analytics | Track learning events by IDs/tags, not unnecessary personal text. |

## Codex Implementation Instructions

- Use this document before implementing related feature code.
- Create typed models/components based on the requirements.
- Add TODOs for later-phase items rather than mixing them into MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Codex can implement from the document without inventing missing product rules.
- MVP requirements are separated from later-phase expansion.
- User roles, data needs, permissions, empty states, errors, and accessibility are considered.
- The document connects back to the core learning loop and locked pillars.
- A reviewer can tell whether a feature is done, incomplete, or out of scope.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] The document separates MVP from later-phase work.
- [ ] The document identifies required data and relationships.
- [ ] The document identifies permissions and safety constraints.
- [ ] The document includes accessibility expectations.
- [ ] The document provides acceptance criteria or completion checks.
- [ ] The document aligns with the 15 locked core pillars.
- [ ] The document avoids passive learning patterns.
- [ ] The document helps Codex build without inventing missing rules.

## Pillar Coverage Reminder
