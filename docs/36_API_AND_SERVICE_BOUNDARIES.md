# API and Service Boundaries

## Purpose

Define where business logic lives so the app does not become a mess of UI-only logic.

## Architecture Philosophy

UI components should render state. Services should handle learning logic, scoring, review scheduling, and data access.

## Suggested Service Areas

```txt
curriculumService
lessonService
quizService
feedbackService
masteryService
reviewService
progressService
permissionService
reportingService
```

## Rules

- Do not calculate mastery directly in UI components.
- Do not schedule reviews inside quiz components.
- Do not put permission checks only in navigation.
- Keep types shared.

## MVP Services

- quizScoring
- masteryEngine
- spacedReviewEngine
- lessonProgress
- dashboardSummary

## Implementation Notes for Codex

- Use pure functions for engines when possible.
- Keep functions unit-testable.
- Avoid premature complex API layers while using local content files.

## Definition of Done

This document is usable when:

- The purpose is clear.
- MVP requirements are separated from later-phase requirements.
- Required screens, data, permissions, and edge cases are identified.
- Codex can implement from it without inventing product rules.
- Safety, accessibility, and learning-pillar impacts are considered.

# V2 Implementation Expansion

## Document Status

- **Version:** 2.0
- **Readiness Target:** Codex-ready implementation guidance
- **Primary Dependency:** AGENTS.md, Product Bible, Core Pillars, MVP Scope
- **Core Learning Loop:** Teach → Break Down → Think → Discuss → Interpret → Prove → Practice → Retrieve → Space → Reflect → Adapt → Apply

## V2 Improvements Added

- Adds MVP versus later-phase boundary.
- Adds user-role implications.
- Adds data dependencies.
- Adds accessibility and safety checks.
- Adds empty/error state expectations.
- Adds acceptance criteria Codex can execute against.

## What This Document Must Lock

- Must align with the saved product loop and core pillars.
- Must not introduce features that bypass child safety or role permissions.
- Must support Grade 3/6/9 MVP before expansion.

## Implementation Requirements

- State screens/components needed.
- List data required and source of truth.
- Define permissions and user states.
- Add validation and QA criteria.
- Define API boundaries for curriculum, lesson progress, quiz attempts, mastery, review, dashboard, and auth.

## Data, Permission, and UX Considerations

| Concern | Required Treatment |
|---|---|
| Student data | Collect only what the feature needs; avoid sensitive logs. |
| Role access | Student, parent, teacher, and admin access must be explicit. |
| Accessibility | Use semantic UI, visible focus states, readable language, and non-color-only signals. |
| Empty states | Define what users see when no lessons, reviews, progress, or linked users exist. |
| Error states | Explain what failed and give a safe next action; never expose private internals. |
| Analytics | Track learning events by IDs/tags, not unnecessary personal text. |

## Codex Implementation Instructions

- Use this document before implementing related feature code.
- Create typed models/components based on the requirements.
- Add TODOs for later-phase items rather than mixing them into MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Codex can implement from the document without inventing missing product rules.
- MVP requirements are separated from later-phase expansion.
- User roles, data needs, permissions, empty states, errors, and accessibility are considered.
- The document connects back to the core learning loop and locked pillars.
- A reviewer can tell whether a feature is done, incomplete, or out of scope.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] The document separates MVP from later-phase work.
- [ ] The document identifies required data and relationships.
- [ ] The document identifies permissions and safety constraints.
- [ ] The document includes accessibility expectations.
- [ ] The document provides acceptance criteria or completion checks.
- [ ] The document aligns with the 15 locked core pillars.
- [ ] The document avoids passive learning patterns.
- [ ] The document helps Codex build without inventing missing rules.

## Pillar Coverage Reminder
