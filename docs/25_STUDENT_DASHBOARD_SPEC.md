# Student Dashboard Specification

## Purpose

Define the main student home screen. This is the student's daily learning command center.

## MVP Dashboard Goals

The dashboard must answer:

- What should I do today?
- What have I completed?
- What do I need to review?
- How am I doing?
- What should I do next?

## Required MVP Sections

1. Welcome card
2. Today's Lessons
3. Memory Vault Reviews Due
4. Subject Progress
5. Mastery Snapshot
6. Recent Achievements
7. Continue Learning button

## Dashboard Data Needed

- Student profile
- Current academy
- Current grade
- Assigned lessons
- Lesson progress
- Skill mastery
- Review items due
- XP/badges later

## Foundation Dashboard Rules

- Use large cards.
- Minimal text.
- Strong visual icons.
- One primary next action.

## Bridge Dashboard Rules

- Show quests, subject paths, and review missions.
- Include weak skill callouts.

## Scholar Dashboard Rules

- Show course progress, assignments, due dates later, portfolio progress, and credit-like indicators.

## Empty States

- No lessons assigned: suggest default next lesson.
- No reviews due: show positive message and continue lesson.
- No progress yet: show first lesson CTA.

## Implementation Notes for Codex

- Create dashboard data adapter before UI hardcoding.
- Use mock data only in clearly labeled seed files.
- Do not mix sample content directly into components.

## Definition of Done

This document is usable when:

- The purpose is clear.
- MVP requirements are separated from later-phase requirements.
- Required screens, data, permissions, and edge cases are identified.
- Codex can implement from it without inventing product rules.
- Safety, accessibility, and learning-pillar impacts are considered.

# V2 Implementation Expansion

## Document Status

- **Version:** 2.0
- **Readiness Target:** Codex-ready implementation guidance
- **Primary Dependency:** AGENTS.md, Product Bible, Core Pillars, MVP Scope
- **Core Learning Loop:** Teach → Break Down → Think → Discuss → Interpret → Prove → Practice → Retrieve → Space → Reflect → Adapt → Apply

## V2 Improvements Added

- Adds MVP versus later-phase boundary.
- Adds user-role implications.
- Adds data dependencies.
- Adds accessibility and safety checks.
- Adds empty/error state expectations.
- Adds acceptance criteria Codex can execute against.

## What This Document Must Lock

- Must align with the saved product loop and core pillars.
- Must not introduce features that bypass child safety or role permissions.
- Must support Grade 3/6/9 MVP before expansion.

## Implementation Requirements

- State screens/components needed.
- List data required and source of truth.
- Define permissions and user states.
- Add validation and QA criteria.
- Dashboard shows today’s lessons, reviews due, mastery summary, current streak, unfinished work, and recommended next step.

## Data, Permission, and UX Considerations

| Concern | Required Treatment |
|---|---|
| Student data | Collect only what the feature needs; avoid sensitive logs. |
| Role access | Student, parent, teacher, and admin access must be explicit. |
| Accessibility | Use semantic UI, visible focus states, readable language, and non-color-only signals. |
| Empty states | Define what users see when no lessons, reviews, progress, or linked users exist. |
| Error states | Explain what failed and give a safe next action; never expose private internals. |
| Analytics | Track learning events by IDs/tags, not unnecessary personal text. |

## Codex Implementation Instructions

- Use this document before implementing related feature code.
- Create typed models/components based on the requirements.
- Add TODOs for later-phase items rather than mixing them into MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Codex can implement from the document without inventing missing product rules.
- MVP requirements are separated from later-phase expansion.
- User roles, data needs, permissions, empty states, errors, and accessibility are considered.
- The document connects back to the core learning loop and locked pillars.
- A reviewer can tell whether a feature is done, incomplete, or out of scope.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] The document separates MVP from later-phase work.
- [ ] The document identifies required data and relationships.
